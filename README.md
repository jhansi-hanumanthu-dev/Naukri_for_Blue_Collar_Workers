## Thought Process & Achievements
How I thought about the problem:

Users searching for jobs often see many different titles for the same kind of work, making it hard to find relevant results.

JobMitra categorizes jobs and makes browsing easy across multiple job titles and languages.

Technology and design choices:

Used React + TypeScript for a robust, type-safe frontend.

Zustand for global state management of language and category.

Responsive CSS for mobile-first design, ensuring usability on all devices.

Challenges I solved:

Multi-language support (English, Hindi, Telugu).

Dynamic filtering of jobs by category.

Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

What I’m most proud of:

Even as a mobile application developer, I successfully developed a full web application from scratch.

The app is fully functional and provides a smooth user experience.

Seeing the final output and knowing I solved a real-world problem makes me very proud.
